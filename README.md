[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) is written by [Gareth James](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/bio.html), [Daniela Witten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniela_Witten), [Trevor Hastie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Hastie), and [Robert Tibshirani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tibshirani).

> This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.

Purpose
-------

I want to improve my statistical knowledge and re-create the graphs from the book using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). I'll be uploading my notes via RMarkdown files as I read the book.

These notes would not be possible without the open-source book, the [`islr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ISLR/index.html) R package and notes made possible from the four authors. I sincerely thank them for sharing their knowledge.

From time to time, I may reference the [free online course taught at Stanford](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
